# tasmota-ir-codes
A slowly growing collection of captured ir codes via tasmota-ir (and the ufo-r1 module) in digital format, meaning no raw codes(1).

If you happen to *have* a code or codes for a specific model feel free to add them (via your most comforable way. Yes, sending them via Message or eMail is just fine, will include a notice of your contribution.)

If you *need* a code or codes for a specific model, please open a issue with details. I'll see what I can figure out.

(1) Regarding raw codes, you can read about them here: http://www.hifi-remote.com/infrared/IR-PWM.shtml.
